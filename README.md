## Technologies Used

                      https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?inv=1&invt=Abo0hw&project=fire-449319

-Instructions for setup can also be found here:  https://youtu.be/3wC-SCdJK2c?si=T3V3mmZFDGOX6XFB

-After creating an account, it is recommended that you also align with the Google Sheet format for a smoother transition. The Google Sheet setup that we recommend is :

              Ticker	Name	Shares	Average Cost	Share Price	Total Equity	Total Cost	Total Gain/Loss	%Gain / Loss	Allocation	


- Also, make sure to carefully look at comments to see where you would make the program work for your own stock portfolio.
